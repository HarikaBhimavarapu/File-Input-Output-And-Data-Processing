# File I/O and Data Processing Project

This project demonstrates basic file I/O operations and data processing using Python. It reads data from a CSV file, processes it to calculate statistics, and writes the results to a new CSV file.

## Project Overview

- **Data Input:** Reads user data from a CSV file (`users.csv`).
- **Data Processing:** Calculates the average age and average salary of the users.
- **Data Output:** Writes the calculated statistics to a new CSV file (`processed_data.csv`).

## Project Structure

- `data/users.csv`: Contains the user data with columns for Name, Age, and Salary.
- `src/process_data.py`: The main script that performs file I/O operations and data processing.
- `results/processed_data.csv`: Output file with processed statistics.

## Installation
